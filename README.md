The intent of this project is to practice making a CRUD app from a blank skeleton. I'll start off using assests from an older site of mine, but may change them later on.

The initial "feature-complete" goal is to create a multi-user blog with posting capabilities, alongside a gallery/portfolio with project pages.
- Users should be capable of registering and contributing blog posts and comment on other user's posts.
- One user will be marked as "admin" and have special privilages on the site. TBD how exactly I'll implement that.
- Galleries should display all projects for a given user
- Blogs should display all blog posts for a given user
